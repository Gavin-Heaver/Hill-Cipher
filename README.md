# Hill-Cipher

<b>The Hill Cipher project was developed to produce ciphertext from plaintext through the Hill cipher algorithm. The Hill cipher algorithm uses linear algebra via multiplying a block of 'n' letters in the plaintext against an 'n'x'n' key matrix, the result of which goes against modulus 26 to find the ciphertext of the block. This project was completed in accordance to my Security in Computing course.</b>
